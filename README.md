# NodeJS-Practices

This folder will contain my practices with NodeJS

/node-farm

- Playing around with filesystem module
- Server building
- Templating html
- Modules

/how-node-works

- event loops
- events (playing around with event emitter and seeing event emitter in action with other modules)
- streams (backpressure, using pipe(), using event emitters with different types of streams)
- how modules work (caching, exports, modules)
