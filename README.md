# NodeJS-Practices

This folder will contain my practices with NodeJS. Some practices are not new to me; but I still felt like it would be good to refresh them and just go over all of them.

/node-farm

- Playing around with filesystem module
- Server building
- Templating html
- Modules

/how-node-works

- event loops
- events (playing around with event emitter and seeing event emitter in action with other modules)
- streams (backpressure, using pipe(), using event emitters with different types of streams)
- how modules work (caching, exports, modules)

/async

- Returning promises in functions to chain them
- Async/Await in NodeJS
- Promise.all
